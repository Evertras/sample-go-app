# Sample Go App

A super simple HTTP service that doesn't actually do anything useful on its own.
Used for reference purposes for all the tooling/testing/boilerplate that goes
around an actually useful service.

Uses [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) for testing.

Uses [Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold) for local
development to a k8s cluster.

Uses good ol' [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
for all development dependencies.
